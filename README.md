# BOOM-SHARP

## About

Boom-sharp is a C# port of Zach Holman's [boom](https://github.com/holman/boom). It's essentially a key-value store, driven from the command line, or, more succintly, *"Motherfucking TEXT SNIPPETS! On the COMMAND LINE!"*

## Install

Installation is a little lame for now. Download the source and build in your favorite .NET IDE (Visual Studio or MonoDevelop). Boom-sharp uses a few .NET 4.0 features, so you'll need the latest version of MonoDevelop or Visual Studio.

## Usage

Coming Soon.
